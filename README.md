Simulation of how the different tribes of Atlantis would interact with each other.

Generally this simulation assumes that:

* All the elements of each tribe flocking with each other.

* The fishes fear the Trench tribe.

* The Trench tribe fear the Brine tribe and the Aquaman. They also hunt the fish.

* The Brine tribe wont hunt nor fear anyone(even if the trench are afraid of them).

* The Fisherman tribe wont hunt nor fear anyone.

* Aquaman flocks with the Brine and Fisherman tribes(even if theses tribes wont flock with him) and hunts the Trench tribe **hard**



This project is inspired by Daniel Shiffman and his [Flocking simulation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhjuuHl6qHM)
